There isn't another industry that incentivizes collaboration as much as software. [90%](https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf) of our industry runs on open source software. [_*Nix_](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unix_history-simple.svg) is the most iconic example and will [power humanity's voyage](https://web.archive.org/web/20211007014843/https://old.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gxb7j1/we_are_the_spacex_software_team_ask_us_anything/ft63jxc/?context=3) into the cosmos, while _TensorFlow_ leads AI research, powering humanity's efforts to eradicate itself /s. [Comp](https://github.com/Netflix)[anies](https://github.com/facebook) love contributing to open source; some [_are_ open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat). They write in meticulous detail about their [engineering](https://eng.uber.com/) [processes](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering) and sometimes publish [incredible documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

Programmers also seem to share more information about their work than any other profession on the internet, for reasons I've theorized about [here](). You can find mistakes and general advice in _abundance_ on discussion forums, and pick up invaluable insights from writers like [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/index.html) and [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). Here are some more favorites:

- [Max Hodak](https://maxhodak.com/) (no code)
- [Amjad Masad](https://amasad.me/)
- [Dave Cheney](https://dave.cheney.net/)

Given all this collaboration and transparency, and because I enjoy writing anyway, contributing my own thoughts in blog format feels natural– [this post](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) from Steve Yegge was the catalyst, and here we are.

If just a handful of people find what I produce truly valuable or perspective-changing, I would consider this a productive use of my time. And given my age and the current state of longevity research, I can reasonably expect the next century of my life to hold ample opportunity for interesting blog posts, so this seems likely.
