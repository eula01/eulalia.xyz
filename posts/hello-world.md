There isn't another industry that incentivizes collaboration as much as software. [90%](https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf) of our industry runs on open source. [\*Nix](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unix_history-simple.svg) is the most iconic example and will [power humanity's voyage](https://web.archive.org/web/20211007014843/https://old.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gxb7j1/we_are_the_spacex_software_team_ask_us_anything/ft63jxc/?context=3) into space, while TensorFlow leads AI research, powering humanity's efforts to eradicate itself /s. Companies [lo](https://github.com/Netflix)[ve](https://github.com/facebook) contributing to open source; some [_are_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat) open source. They [wri](https://eng.uber.com/)[te](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering) about their engineering processes in meticulous detail, encouraging competitors.

Programmers also share lots of information about their work individually, more so than other professions. Discussion threads can often reveal valuable insights if you dig through them, [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) being consistent at that. Writers like [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/index.html) and [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) provide condensed wisdom through sheer experience.

I'm excited to contribute my own ideas, mostly about programming or philosophy. If only a handful of people find what I produce on this blog valuable, I would consider it a success. This seems likely given the state of longevity research; I should be able to reach at least a few intriguing conclusions over the next 150 years or so.
