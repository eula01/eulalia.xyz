There isn't another industry that incentivizes collaboration as much as tech does. [90%](https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf) of our industry runs on open source software. [\*Nix](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unix_history-simple.svg) is the most iconic example and will [power humanity's voyage](https://web.archive.org/web/20211007014843/https://old.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gxb7j1/we_are_the_spacex_software_team_ask_us_anything/ft63jxc/?context=3) into space, while TensorFlow leads AI research, powering humanity's efforts to eradicate itself /s. Companies [lo](https://github.com/Netflix)[ve](https://github.com/facebook) contributing to open source; some [_are_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat) open source. They [wri](https://eng.uber.com/)[te](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering) about their engineering processes in meticulous detail, encouraging competitors.

Programmers also share lots of information about their work individually, more so than other professions. Discussion threads can often reveal valuable insights if you dig through them, [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) being consistent at that. Writers like [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/index.html) and [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) condense wisdom into very digestable reads.

I'm excited to contribute my own ideas, mostly on programming or philosophy. If just a handful of people find what I produce on this blog valuable, I'd consider it a success, which seems likely given the state of longevity research; I have around ~150 years to say something interesting.
