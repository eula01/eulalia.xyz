Python development is fast. A succinct syntax lets you crunch through business logic with minimal line counts. An extensive standard library and frameworks like Django can reduce your time-to-market significantly. A shallow learning curve means you can get away with hiring generalists and giving them a crash course, and its popularity means there's a large pool of competent programmers to begin with.

However, in most cases, time saved writing Python probably doesn't increase development speed proportionally. In adherence to [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), your time savings can easily be siphoned off into random "tasks".

Python has one of these "tasks" built-in and it can be highly engaging, especially for certain OCD-ish or competitive personality types. It's trying to make your Python code look as elegant and idiomatic as possible while maintaining readability, by combining list comprehensions, negative indexing, and other high-level language features. Some _Pythonistas_ are excellent at this and can craft impressive one-liners without making you think too much, despite the subjective end of 'readability'.

And unless your goal is Python mastery, then your productivity suffers every time you enter an hour of unintentional flow state to indulge in compulsions of descending arbitrary [gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) that don't matter.

Of course, the easiest solution is a competent manager that can set deadlines relative to how fast you work. But external discipline isn't always available, so you'll have to [develop new alarms](http://www.paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html) and be aware when you're doing fake work.

## Pythonic Tendencies

In an attempt to be more pythonic, I tried to squeeze multiple array lookups on the same line. The problem is that if one of those lookups is out of range, then you wonâ€™t know which one threw the exception:

```py
>>> foo = [9, 3, 7]
>>> bar = [2, 1, 9]
>>> print(foo[5], bar[2])

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 3, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
```

As shown, the traceback only returns the line number and **not the column offset**. The obvious solution is to:

```py
>>> print(
>>>     foo[5], 
>>>     bar[2]
>>> )
```

But... you're asking me to make a 300% line count increase in Python? That feels way too hacky and dissatisfying.

I personally think this is a design oversight. Why would a language that puts so much emphasis on brevity not handle cases where people try to be brief?

Lets check if the bytecode has some insight.

```py
>>> import dis
>>> 
>>> test = '''
...        foo = [9, 3, 7]
...        bar = [2, 1, 9]
...        print(foo[5], bar[2])
...        '''
>>> print(dis.dis(compile(test, "", "exec")))

#  line     instruction     opcode         oparg      the actual resolved 
# number      number                                      argument

  2           0           LOAD_CONST         0          (9)
              2           LOAD_CONST         1          (3)
              4           LOAD_CONST         2          (7)
              6           BUILD_LIST         3          
              8           STORE_NAME         0          (foo)

  3          10           LOAD_CONST         3          (2)
             12           LOAD_CONST         4          (1)
             14           LOAD_CONST         0          (9)
             16           BUILD_LIST         3          
             18           STORE_NAME         1          (bar)

  4          20           LOAD_NAME          2          (print)
             22           LOAD_NAME          0          (foo)
             24           LOAD_CONST         5          (5)
             26           BINARY_SUBSCR   
             28           LOAD_NAME          1          (bar)
             30           LOAD_CONST         3          (2)
             32           BINARY_SUBSCR   
             34           CALL_FUNCTION      2          
             36           POP_TOP         
             38           LOAD_CONST         6          (None)
             40           RETURN_VALUE
```
BTW, `line number` (leftmost column) starts at `2` because source files are 1-indexed, and there are no operations on line 1.

Looking at the `BINARY_SUBSCR` operation (instruction number `26`), we can see that the lookup on `foo` is evaluated before the lookup on `bar`, but that still doesn't tell us which one threw the `IndexError`. This means the bytecode itself has lost access to the column number.

When Python is [compiled](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201803/is_python_interpreted_or_compiled_yes.html), we drop a bunch of meta-resolution about the source code to remove noise and increase performance, leaving the PythonVM with only what it needs, thus **all runtime errors** lack detail. 

To highlight this, let's look at an error that is thrown _before runtime_, i.e. during parsing:

```py
>>> foo = [1, 2 3]
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    foo = [1, 2 3]
                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Here, the column offset is shown with the little `^`. So, is it possible to get this resolution at runtime too?


## PEP 657: Harbinger of Clarity

Behold [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/), authored by Pablo Galindo, which proposes a mapping between instruction numbers and column offsets on each line. It's implemented in Python 3.11, which is currently in alpha and set to release in October 2022! You can test it out [here](https://github.com/python/cpython).

It will make our traceback from earlier look something like this:

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    print(foo[5], bar[5])
          ~~~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range
```

As we've discussed, a feature like this carries a memory cost, which the authors have acknowledged:

> we propose an opt-out mechanism which will cause generated code objects to not have the extra information

That opt-out flag is `-Xno_debug_ranges`, which you can pass to `python`.

Pablo waits for Pablo:
